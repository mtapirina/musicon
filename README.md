# Musicon
##Codecademy - Handlebars project

_In this project, you will be updating the website of an online musical instruments store, Musicon. You will incorporate your knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars to make a stylish multi-page interactive website!_

__Musicon will have three separate web pages: a home page, a store page, and a contacts page. The home and store pages already have most of the HTML and CSS set up. Your job is to make the following changes:__

* 		Create a navigation bar using unordered lists, anchor tags, and class attributes.
* 		Style the website using your knowledge of display, positioning, color, and font declarations.
* 		Build out semantic templates using a client-side templating engine: Handlebars.
* 		Display relevant information using JavaScript objects, arrays, and control flow alongside built-in Handlebars iteration and control flow helpers.

__If you want to challenge yourself, consider:__

* 		Add/Remove instruments to the store.
* 		Change the overall layout of the website.
* 		Create additional styling in public/style.css.
* 		Add and link to an additional page for Musicon.
